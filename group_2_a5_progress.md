# Story

Our animation will be a scene involving a car driving along side a road with a sun/moon rising and setting. Below the sun but above the road will have clouds that will produce occasionally produce rain and a thunder sound. This sequence will continue on indefinitely. There will also be key presses to control the camera.

# Description of Objects
## Clouds (Jeffrey)
The clouds texture will be imported from a `.obj` file, particularly from https://www.turbosquid.com/3d-models/3d-cloud-polygon-blender-1-model-1895708. Each cloud will move in the direction of the car with a parameter controlling the rain intensity and the thunder intensity. As the cloud moves, the rain will also move with the same horizontal velocity, similar to assignment 4. I will try experimenting with different droplet shapes (ellipse, circle, obj, etc.) and try to animate lightning. However, this proved to be difficult in A4 as I could not find a suitable lightning shape.

## Road and Car (Tarun)
The foreground will have a road with a car on it. The car and wheels will be `.obj` files. The car will consist of the body and the wheels, where the body might have the doors, door handles, windows, and headlights. The car will be moving across the screen from the left to the right same direction as the clouds, and the wheels will be rotating as the car is moving. I am considering adding more vehicles to the screen or making it so that as the car leaves a screen a new colored car enters the screen.


## Sun and Moon (Yawer)
The Sun and Moon will be `.obj` files. They will go along a bezier curve and the background color will be changing from night, day, and sunrise rgb colors using a lerpcolor function. I might create a "dome" that will have stars on it and the sun-moon objects will go on a path along it. I'm not sure how feasable this would be, but the dome would also have stars for night time that sparkle.

# Classes
## Cloud
Like in A4, the cloud position will be controlled by a position vector `pos` and its speed will be controlled by a float `speed` indicating the number of pixels to travel per frame using the `lerp` method. The clouds will move at a linear speed. The parameter `rain_intensity` will control the intensity of the rain and the size of the array that stores the droplets in the `Cloud` class. If lightning is implemented, it will be parameterized with respect to `rain_intensity`. The color of the clouds will be controlled by `rain_intensity` as well, ranging from white to gray depending on the intensity. The number of clouds initialized will vary depending on a global parameter in `setup()`.

## Sun and Moon
The Sun and Moon will be `.obj` files whose x and y coordinates will be determined by a bezier curve using the `bezierPoint` function. The background color will change continuously using `lerpcolor`. The speed of the translation across the sky will be hard set and will not change. I will use a boolean value to change switch between the sun and moon. I had difficulties implementing this in A4, but I wanted to have a good way to control the time of day and have that control the background color. I will experiment with this a bit more in this project. 

# Car
The car class will have the following parameters:

pos (PVector): x,y center of the car
speed (float, default = 1): How fast the car is moving per frame (how many pixels)
start_loc (float, default = 0): The starting location of the object
wheel_angle (float): How fast the wheels rotate
Similar to the last assignment, the object will be going in a straight line across the screen. The pos is the position of the car, and the speed is how fast it moves across the screen. I will use the different geometry methods to create the different components of the vehicle, and then use the circle method to create wheels that will rotate as the car moves across the screen. Then once the car reaches the end of the screen, a new car with a different color will start driving onto the screen. There will be no user input. I might try to input some depth to make it seem like the car is swerving on the road if possible.
